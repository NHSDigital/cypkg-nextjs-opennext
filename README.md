# cypkg-nextjs-opennext

This package is a template for creating a new package with Next.js and OpenNext.  As installed it will provide the blog example from [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

To install to a new package, run:

```bash
coyote new nextjs-opennext my-new-application
```

This is a very pre-alpha version of the package.  It is not yet ready for general use.
